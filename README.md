# Functional Swift Intro
Playground to illustrate functional programming concepts in Swift for the Orlando iOS Meetup
Be sure to check out the book [*Functional Swift*](https://www.objc.io/books/functional-swift/), from the authors of objc.io. Most examples in this playground were sourced from this great book.
